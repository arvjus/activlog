<h2>About</h2>
Want to track your day-to-day routines, sport activities? <b>Activity Logger</b> is an application that allows you to keep track on activities you perform on a regular basis. But it is not limited to, you can record and track anything you want.<br>
It helps you understand how regularly you perform repeating activities, provides statistical information on duration, rating or anything else you choose to log.
<p>
With application you will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Log activity events by using predefined activity template. (e.g. <i>Jogging</i>; <i>distance</i>: 5km, <i>duration</i>: 30min)</li>
<li>Display statistics for a given period of time</li>
<li>Define your own activity templates with custom-defined attributes</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>
You can get start with application by setting date format, measurement units and other options in preferences window (accessible via menu).
<p>
Then you have to define activity templates in <b>Activities</b> tab. First you create a new activity or select an existing one. Then you can define attributes for selected activity. Activity/attribute name has to be unique within corresponding list. If you mark as <i>"invisible"</i> for an item, this item will not appear in <b>Logging</b> or <b>Statistics</b> tabs. Try to set appropriate field type, this will select suitable virtual keyboard when you start typing value later in <b>Logging</b> tab.<br>
Note you should pay extra attention if you want do delete unwanted items. This operation removes all related information in event logs and attributes.
<p>
After desired templates has been defined, you can start logging events in <b>Logging</b> tab. Date field, which is required, set to today's date and can be changed with date picker dialog, just press on date field and hold for a couple seconds. Other fields are optional and set to their default values if they where defined. If you omit an optional field value (i.e. leave a field empty) this field will not be logged.<br>
Application comes with two predefined activities, so you can start practicing immediately right after program installation. You can later delete them or mark them as <i>"invisible"</i>.
<p>
And finally you can view summary of your logged information in <b>Statistics</b> tab. You can change initially set date range with date pickers. After selecting desired fields you can display data in form of table graphical chart.
